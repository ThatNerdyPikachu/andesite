# Config Schema v2

Version 2

---------

The configuration file is located at `~/.config/andesite/config.json`

There are a number of options that are also required and can be used to configure your Andesite instance from within your `config.json`. They are listed here.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `"version"` | `int` | `1` | Config version, must be set to `2`. |
| `"root"` | `string` | **Required.** | A relative or absolute path to where the data root Andesite should serve private files from. |
| `"public"` | `string` | None. | Similar to `--root`, but served from `/public/` and no authorization is required to see file listings or download. Like a regular Open Directory. |
| `"port"` | `uint` | `8000` | The port to bind to. A webserver will be launched accessible from `localhost:{port}`. |
| `"themes"` | `[]string` | ` ` | A array of names to load themes from. Read more about themes below. |
| `"base"` | `string` | `/` | The root path Andesite will be served from. See [`deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for more info. |
| `"clients"` | `[]AppConf` | ` ` | An array of OA2 app configs, that can be used with providers created in `"providers"`. See [`appconf.go`](https://github.com/nektro/go.oauth2#appconf-schema) for more info. |
| `"providers"` | `[]Provider` | ` ` | An array of custom OAuth2 providers that you may use as your `"auth"`. See [`provider.go`](https://github.com/nektro/go.oauth2#provider-schema) for more info. |

## Upgrade Notes
From v1 you may notice a few things,

- `"custom"` has been renamed to `"clients"`.
- `"auth"` and top-level app confs have been removed and merged into `"clients"`.
- Due to this merge, multiple Identity Providers can be activated at a time.

### Multiple Identity Providers
When a user is sent to `/login` it will attempt to log them in with the IDP defined first in the list in `"clients"`. To use any other other defined clients, send them to `/login?with={code}` with `{code}` being the client short-code such as `reddit`, `github`, etc.

## Example
A fully configured `config.json` would now look like this for example.
```json
{
    "version": 2,
	"root": "/mnt/private/",
	"public": "/mnt/public/",
    "port": 8000,
    
    "themes": [
        "andesite-theme-dark",
        "andesite-theme-mine"
    ],
    "clients": [
        {
            "for": "discord",
            "id": "",
            "secret": "",
            "extra_1": "",
            "extra_2": ""
        },
        {
            "for": "reddit",
            "id": "",
            "secret": ""
        },
        {
            "for": "my_gitea",
            "id": "",
            "secret": ""
        }
    ],
    "providers": [
		{
			"id": "my_gitea",
			"authorize_url": "",
			"token_url": "",
			"me_url": "",
			"scope": "",
			"name_prop": "",
			"name_prefix": ""
		}
	]
}
```
