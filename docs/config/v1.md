# Config Schema v1

Version 1

---------

The configuration file is located at `~/.config/andesite/config.json`

There are a number of options that are also required and can be used to configure your Andesite instance from within your `config.json`. They are listed here.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `"version"` | `int` | `1` | Config version, must be `1`. |
| `"root"` | `string` | **Required.** | A relative or absolute path to where the data root Andesite should serve private files from. |
| `"port"` | `uint` | `8000` | The port to bind to. A webserver will be launched accessible from `localhost:{port}`. |
| `"themes"` | `[]string` | ` ` | A array of names to load themes from. Read more about themes below. |
| `"base"` | `string` | `/` | The root path Andesite will be served from. See [`deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for more info. |
| `"providers"` | `[]Provider` | ` ` | An array of custom OAuth2 providers that you may use as your `"auth"`. See [`provider.go`](https://github.com/nektro/go.oauth2#provider-schema) for more info. |
| `"custom"` | `[]AppConf` | ` ` | An array of OA2 app configs, that can be used with providers created in `"providers"`. See [`appconf.go`](https://github.com/nektro/go.oauth2#appconf-schema) for more info. |
| `"public"` | `string` | None. | Similar to `--root`, but served from `/public/` and no authorization is required to see files listings or download. Like a regular OD. |

A fully configured `config.json` may look like this for example.
```json
{
	"root": "/mnt/private/",
	"public": "/mnt/public/",
	"auth": "my_gitea",
    "port": 8000,

		}
	]
}
```

> Multiple themes can be used at time.
